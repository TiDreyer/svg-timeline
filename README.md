# svg-timeline

A pure python library to create timeline plots.

## Documentation
At the current time (`0.2.2`), this library is still in an early development state.
Because I still expect the API to undergo larger changes until version `1.0`,
there is no extensive user documentation yet.

- For a rough usage overview, please take a look at the example below.
- For more technical information, you can read the [ADRs](https://github.com/TiDreyer/svg-timeline/tree/main/ADRs).

### Example
This is the result of running the script [`examples/emmy_noether.py`](https://github.com/TiDreyer/svg-timeline/blob/main/examples/emmy_noether.py):
